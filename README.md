# PBL_only_finance

----- Welcome ------ 

--> This repository has the code to our PBL project, it is divided in the following parts:
   1) html code set for site frontend (templates)
   2) css for site styling
   3) flask (python) for backend of site
   4) the actual python code itself

--> The folder system is as follows :
   -- candlestick based --> gemini flask + original efforts
      --> gemini flask --> 
                          + templates(html site pages ) 
                          + server.py(flask file (handles the transfer of data)) 
                          + run.py(python file with all the code for the indicators)
      --> original efforts -->   
                          +   algotrading patterns.py (has the original logic for all the indicators)
                          + * app.py (intial attempt to run flask ( now meaning less))
                          +   bullish reversals.py (file with the initial base code i.e. the starting code (the og budgeting help part))
                          + * run.py (has the ready to use code for all the indicators)
                          +   login.html and result.html (initial attempts of building the website (now useless))
